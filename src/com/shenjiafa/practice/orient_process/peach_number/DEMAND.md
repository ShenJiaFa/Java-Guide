The monkey picked a few peaches on the first day, and immediately ate half of them. He felt that it was not enough, so
he ate another one and ate half of the remaining peaches the day before. I ate half of the remaining peaches the day
before yesterday, but I thought it was not enough. I ate another one and found that there was only 1 peach on the 10th
day. Demand: How many peaches did the monkey pick on the first day?
